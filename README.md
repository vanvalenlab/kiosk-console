The `kiosk-console` is the entry point for users to spin up a DeepCell Kiosk, a cloud-native implementation of the DeepCell ecosystem.

The DeepCell Kiosk is designed to allow researchers to easily deploy and scale a deep learning platform for biological image analysis. Once launched, users can drag-and-drop images to be processed in parallel using publicly available, or custom-built, TensorFlow models. To train custom models, please refer to [deepcell-tf](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf), which was designed to facilitate model development and is capable of exporting these models for use with the DeepCell Kiosk.

The scalability of the DeepCell Kiosk software is enabled by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). At present, the Kiosk is only compatible with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

An example of the DeepCell Kiosk is live at [DeepCell.org](https://deepcell.org).

## Features

- Cloud-based deployment of deep-learning models
- Scalable platform that minimizes cost and inference time
- Drag and drop interface for running predictions

## Getting Started

Start a terminal shell and install the DeepCell Kiosk wrapper script:

```bash
docker run -e DOCKER_TAG=1.8.0 vanvalenlab/kiosk-console:1.8.0 | sudo bash
```

To start the kiosk, just run `kiosk-console` from the terminal shell.

Check out our [docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master/GETTING_STARTED.html) for more information on how to start your own kiosk.

## Software Architecture

![Kiosk Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-console/master/docs/images/Kiosk_Architecture.png)

- [Consumer](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-redis-consumer): Retrieves items from the Job Queue and handles the processing pipeline for that item. Each consumer only works on one item at a time.

- [Model Server](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-tf-serving): Serves models over a gRPC API, allowing consumers to send data and get back predictions.

- [GPU Autoscaler](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-autoscaler): Automatically and efficiently scales Kubernetes GPU resources.

- [Frontend](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-frontend): API for creating and managing jobs, and a React-based web interface for the DeepCell Kiosk.

- _Additional Data Entry Tools_:

  - [ImageJ Plugin](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-imageJ-plugin): An ImageJ 1.x plugin for processing images with an existing cluster.

  - [Command-line Interface](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-client): A python-based CLI for submitting and managing DeepCell Kiosk jobs.

- _Not pictured above_:

  - [Bucket Monitor](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-bucket-monitor): Purges the bucket of uploaded and processed files that are older than `AGE_THRESHOLD`, 3 days by default.

  - [Janitor](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-redis-janitor): Monitors in-progress items and makes sure no jobs get left un-finished.
